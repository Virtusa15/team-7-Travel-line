The concept of content commerce providers is relatively simple in theory. Provide customers with quality content that entertains, informs, and inspires. 
The products from the online shop are embedded in this content world. This ensures that the customers spend a long time on the shop pages, can be stimulated to buy and
 recommend the shop as possible even friends and acquaintances.
Nowadays, customers want to know and interact with the brand at multiple touch points. They also want to know the brand’s story. we would uncover ways to woo customers without having to interrupt them so much with advertising and digital
 communications. I would focus on delivering “experiences” in a micro sense – by combining platforms like WordPress and BigCommerce to make the management of Content and Commerce easier and more seamless for the user.
